Vidyanath. The book comprises of the text and the \\ntranslation with detailed comments and updated information on different aspects which are very useful \\nfor the present generation of readership today. The efforts to add the botanical names and photographs \\nof many medicinal plants to provide useful lead to correlate the same with the classical Sanskrit names \\nare commendable. The designed diagrams of some surgical instruments and certain treatment \\nprocedures are really interesting particularly in the context of the study of a Samhita Grantha. This \\neffort obviously adopts the message of Vagbhata himself who stated at the very outset of Astariga \\nSarigraha, that this treatise is being created to make Ayurveda Sastra yuganurupa. \\n\\nThe language of the write-up and the overall presentation of the book is easy to go through for a maiden \\nreader. The entire approach appears critical and creative exercising adequate care to conserve the \\noriginality of the book and its contemporary readability. I hope this new addition to the contemporary \\nAyurvedic literature will benefit the students and teachers of Ayurveda in pursuing the subject in a \\nright perspective. \\n\\nAstariga Hrdaya is an important classic text of great educational significance as it is prescribed as a text \\nbook for graduate students in view of its easy accessibility and because it is a better organized text than \\nthe Astariga Sarigraha. \\n\\nThe galaxy of Foundation texts of Ayurveda comprise of two sets of authentic texts fondly called 1. \\nBrhattrayi and 2. Laghutrayi. Brhattrayi texts are 1. Caraka Samhita, 2. Susruta Sarhhita and 3. The \\nSarhhitas of Vagbhata (Sarigraha and Hrdaya). Most often the Astariga Hrdaya is counted among the \\nBrhattrayi, not so often the Astariga Sarigraha. However many scholars believe that Astariga Sarigraha \\nis the prime text of Vagbhata. \\n\\nThe Laghutrayi texts are 1. Madhava Nidana (900 AD), 2. Sarrigadhara Samhita (1300 AD) and 3. \\nBhavaprakasa ( 1 600 AD). The historians consider the Brhattrayi texts, especially Caraka and Susruta, \\nas the pre-Christian texts while Laghutrayi are the medieval texts. \\n\\nIn Indian historical traditions there have been several scholars holding the name of Vagbhata. The \\nfamous Ayurvedic texts Astariga Sarigraha and Astariga Hrdaya are also authored by the one or the \\nother Vagbhata. Vagbhata represents the golden age of the Indian history, i.e. Gupta period and hence \\nit gives a literary glimpse of the Ayurvedic tradition and cultural status of that period in India. There \\nhas been a controversy where the author of Astariga Sarigraha and Astariga Hrdaya is the same \\nVagbhata or they are two different persons. However, considering many facts, it is largely believed \\nthat they were two different persons and the two treatises were written in two different periods of \\nhistory by two different authors. \",\n",

                            " \"There are controversies about the period of Vagbhata. It seems the author of the Astariga Sarigraha, \\nVagbhata's time was somewhere between the period of Vatsyayana (500 AD) and Varahamihira (600 \\nAD). Vatsyayana was an expert of Kamasastra while Varahamihira dealt with another branch of \\nknowledge viz. Jyotisa and Vagbhata was a physician, besides being an erudite poet. The Vagbhata's \\nclassics are largely the collection and codification of facts discovered through the works of Agnivesa - \\nCaraka, and Susruta - Nagarjuna and their contemporaries, besides certain new ideas and facts to \\nupdate the knowledge which seems to be the theme of Vagbhata as is evident by his own statement in \\nthe text: \\n\\nYuganurupasandarbho vibhagena karisyate. (Vagbhata Su. 1:20) \\n\\nSarvatantranyatab pray ah sarhhrtya'stangasangrahah; \\nAsthanavistaraksepah punaruktadivarjitah. (Vagbhata Su. 1:18) \\n\\nIt seems Astariga Hrdaya was compiled by another author later in order to make the subject more \\nconcise and easy to handle. The author of Astanga Sangraha is believed to have greater impact of \\nBuddhism as is evident by author's own omissions to Buddha. The critical comparative study of the \\ntwo texts in terms of the impact of earlier classics like Caraka and Susruta, it is believed that Astariga \\nSangraha has more Caraka's impact while Astariga Hrdaya carries an impact of Susruta. The style and \\napproach of the two texts becomes obvious if one compares the depth and girth of the two texts. \\nAstariga Sarigraha has 150 chapters and Astariga Hrdaya has 120 chapters displayed in different \\ndivisions as described in the following table which reflects the preferential inclusion and exclusion of \\nthe subject matter and the size of the texts. It will be interesting to undertake a critical comparative \\nstudy of all the Samhitas in relation to the period of compilation and the reason of such differences. \",\n",

Astariga Sarigraha is the leading text of Sarigraha style which incorporates the \\nsubject matter from different Tantras and reproduces the same in a summarized form with greater \\nclarity, while Astariga Hrdaya adopts different style. Further it is obvious that ancient classics like \\nCaraka and Susruta deliberated more on the fundamental and philosophic aspects of the subject while \\nthe later texts diverted them from philosophy towards practical aspects. \\n\\nThe present volume under publication by Dr. R. Vidyanath presently limits itself to the Sutra Sthana of \\nAstariga Hrdaya which contains 30 chapters namely 1. Ayuskamiya, 2. Dinacarya, 3. Rtucarya, 4. \\nRoganutpadaniya, 5.

                            " 'During the ancient times, Acaryas of Ayurveda had written voluminous works on different \\nspecialties, which were not tangible to mediocre students. So, the time demanded in writing \\nconcise books, which cover the essentials of all the eight branches of Ayurveda. \\n\\nVagbhata was the first person who composed a treatise entitled Astariga Sarigraha by bringing \\ntogether the relevant medical knowledge contained in Caraka Sarhhita, Susruta Sarhhita, \\nHarita Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Kasyapa Sarhhita etc. \\n\\nThe author himself says \"By churning the great ocean of medical science, a great store of \\nnectar by name Astariga Sarigraha was obtained. From that store of nectar, a short treatise \\nentitled Astariga Hrdaya was written for the benefit of mediocre students\". \\n\\nAcarya Vagbhata was the son of Sirhhagupta and the grand son of Vagbhata belongs to the \\nregion of river Sindhu. His fore fathers were also great scholars of Ayurveda. He was the \\ndisciple of Avalokita, the chief monk of Mahayana Buddhism. Basing on the internal and \\nexternal evidences the date of Vagbhata can be fixed between 4 th and 5 th century AD. \\n\\nAstanga Hrdaya is one of the most celebrated and most often studied treatises on Indian \\nMedicine, after Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita. The work significantly begins with an \\naphoristic preface \"What follows is what was said by great sages, Atreya and others.\" This \\nwork generally follows the general plan of Astariga Sarigraha and divided into six sections, 1 20 \\nchapters. The total number of verses is 7 1 20 in the extant edition. \\n\\nSutra Sthana is the first section contains 30 chapters dealing with Basic principles of \\nAyurveda, preventive measures, diet and dietetics, classification of diseases and methods of \\ntreatments etc. Sarira Sthana is the second section contains 6 chapters dealing with \\nembryology, anatomy, physiology, physical and psychological constitutions, auspicious and \\ninauspicious dreams and omens, signs of bad prognosis etc. Nidana Sthana is the third section \\ncontains 16 chapters dealing with etiological factors, signs and symptoms, pathogenesis and \\nprognosis of important diseases etc. Cikitsa Sthana is the fourth section contains 22 chapters \\ndealing with the line of treatment of various diseases including pathyapathya. Kalpa-Siddhi \\nSthana is the fifth section contains 6 chapters dealing with formulations and methods \\npertaining to elimination therapy, management of complications, principles of pharmacy etc. \\nUttara Tantra is the sixth section contains 40 chapters dealing with the remaining seven \\nbranches of Ayurveda. \\n\\nThis work has as many as 37 commentaries, the largest number for any early medical classics. \\nIt has been translated into many languages viz. Tibetan, Arabic, German etc. In the Tibetan \\ncanon, Tangyur (8 AD) is included a translation of this work along with Caraka Sarhhita and ',\n",

Sarvanga Sundara by Aruna Datta ( 1 200 AD) was edited by Vijaya Ratna Sena Gupta, \\nCalcutta in the year 1 888, and by Anna Moreswara Kunte, Bombay in the year 1 889. \\n\\n2.

As on today sufficient number of Hindi as \\nwell as Regional language translations are available in the market. As a teacher of the \\nconcerned subject for the past decade, I have identified the necessity of proper study material \\nin English language to cater the needs of freshly joined students of Ayurveda. Keeping this in \\nview I have made an attempt to incorporate the translation of the text along with the related \\nmatter compiled from various resources in the form of notes. For a better comprehension, the \\nbook is supplemented with full of illustrations. In the annexure the following material is \\nincorporated. \\n\\n1. Important Essay & Short Questions \\n\\n2.

In case of co-existence of opposing factors the \\nweaker one is overlooked by the stronger and comes into force. \\n\\nNatural order of strength of rasa and others: \\n\\nWhen rasa, vipaka, virya and prabhavas are in equal strength, vipaka defeats rasa, vipaka and \\nrasa together defeated by virya, prabhava defeats all of them. This is the natural order of \\nstrength. \\n\\n* Eg. honey consists of madhura rasa and katu vipaka. Though madhura rasa is capable to \\nmitigate vata due to the dominance of katu vipaka it is increasing vata. Here the rasa is \\ndominated by vipaka. \\n\\n* Even though the meat of buffalo is having madhura rasa and madhura vipaka they will be \\ndominated by usna virya and aggravates pitta. \\n\\n* Similarly sura, a type of wine containing amla rasa, amla vipaka and usna virya, they were \\ndominated by prabhava and acts as a galactogogue. \\n\\nPrabhava \\n\\n(Specific Action) \\n\\nWhere there is similarity in two drugs in relation to their rasa, vipaka and virya but in spite of \\nthis similarity these two drugs differ in their action. The distinctive feature responsible for their \\ndistinctive effects not supported by their rasa, vipaka and virya is considered as prabhava or \\nspecific action. \\n\\nEg. both citraka (Plumbago zeylanica) and da/?f/(Balliospermum montanum) are katu rasa, \\nkatu vipaka and usna virya. But, in spite of this similarity danti acts as a purgative while citraka ',\n",
                            " \"172 Astanga Hrdayam : Sutra-sthana \\n\\ncreates constipation. Similarly draksa and yastimadhu are having similar properties; draksa \\nacts as a laxative while yasti causes constipation. \\n\\nThough ghee and milk are having madhura rasa, sita virya and madhura vipaka, ghee increases \\nthe power of digestion whereas milk doesn't. \\n\\nVicitra pratyayarabdha dravya: \\n\\nTill now the general mode of action of the drugs has been described. In addition there is a \\nspecial category of substances known as vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya. \\n\\nEg. even though both wheat and barley are having madhura rasa and guru guna, wheat \\nmitigates vata where as barley aggravates vata. \\n\\nThough milk and fish are having madhura rasa and guru guna, their virya is differed with one \\nanother as sita and usna respectively. \\n\\nSimilarly meat of lion and boar are also having madhura rasa and guru guna. Boar's meat will \\nbe transformed into madhura vipaka at the end of the digestion, as it is samana pratyayarabdha \\ndravya. Whereas lion's meat is transformed into katu vipaka as it is vicitra pratyayarabdha \\ndravya. \\n\\nThus ends the ninth chapter entitled Dravyadi Vijnamya Adhyaya of Sutra \\nSthana in Astariga Hrdaya Samhita, which was composed by Acarya \\nVagbhata son of Sri Vaidyapati Simhagupta. \\n\\nIn the chapter Dravyadi Vijnamya, Acarya Vagbhata explained the basic concepts of \\nDravyaguna such as rasa, guna, virya, vipaka, prabhava etc. Definition of rasa, actions, \\nqualities of 5 kinds of substances parthiva, jaliya etc. Definition of virya, different types of \\nvipaka and prabhava. Samana pratyayarabdha dravya, vicitra pratyayarabdha dravya etc. have \\nbeen discussed in detail. \",\n",

Rasa \\n\\nThe taste does not manifest itself while the water is in the atmosphere. As soon as it starts \\nfalling on the ground it comes in contact with the atoms of five basic elements impelled by the \\natmosphere itself and there comes the first stage of the manifestation of the rasa. The \\nculminating point of this manifestation is however reached when the water falls on the ground \\nand it comes in contact with the individuals of plant and animal kingdom. At this stage the six \\ntastes manifests themselves in the individuals. Different seasons also play an important role, in \\nthe manifestation of tastes by the combination of the basic elements in different proportions. \\n\\nRelationship of pa ilea mahabhutas with the tastes: \\n\\nMadhura and other rasas will be formed due to the predominance of two, two mahabhutas as \\nunder. \",\n",

A coherent understanding of degradation mechanisms is yet to emerge. We focus on intrinsic degradation of high quality Alq3 based diodes due to electrical stressing. We monitor progressive luminance degradation and recovery by introducing well defined relaxation time windows in the current stress cycles. The method helps to clearly distinguish between recoverable and permanent degradation systematically. The voltage shift due to degradation and recovery is also monitored as a function of time. Further, we introduce a method of reconstructing the transients of the recoverable part using progressive isolated current pulses as a probe. The recovery of degradation is related to the charging and discharging of the traps in the device and our method provides a technique of measuring significant parameters of trapping through luminance transients. The origin and distinguishing features of the two types of degradation are discussed.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Though voltage (V) dependence of current (I) and capacitance (C) have been extensively studied in the literature, there are several features which are yet to be coherently explained. There have been several reports on the origin of C-V peaks attributing them to various mechanisms such as competition between diffusion and drift, traps, and carrier recombination etc. However, there is lack of knowledge on the origin of the nature of the C-V peak. In this paper we carry out a correlated study of I-V and C-V characteristics as a function of temperature for four different popular active materials to obtain a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. High quality diodes are fabricated with low leakage current so as to obtain large rectification. In the case of MEH-PPV and NPB, I-V characteristics show temperature independent hysteresis and signature of charge storage at interfaces. This is absent in P3HT:PCBM and pentacene:C60 based devices. In the case of MEH-PPV, pentacene:C60 and NPB, the shape of the C-V are similar (rises sharply but falls slowly) but the amplitude of the peaks varies with temperature. We correlate this to competition between drift diffusion giving rise to the peak. In the case of the P3HT:PCBM the shape is almost symmetrical on both sides of the peak, which seems to arise from the recombination losses. The peak positions are independent of temperature (in the range studied) in all these cases. In the case of pentacene:C60, as the temperature is increased, a second peak in C-V starts to appear. From the I-V, it is very clear that it is related to trapping phenomena. A thorough analysis of data is shown in Figure 1 and generalized view of correlation between I-V and C-V will be presented.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",
