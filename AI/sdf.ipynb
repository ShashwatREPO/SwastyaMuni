In samples irradiated with doses below amorphization threshold, besides divacancy related trap, a new midgap acceptor trap level is isolated and shown to be responsible for carrier compensation. This defect level controls hysteresis in C-V characteristics and space charge limited current conduction in I-V characteristics. Possible origin of this defect have been discussed in the light of defect migration and cluster formation.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

A coherent understanding of degradation mechanisms is yet to emerge. We focus on intrinsic degradation of high quality Alq3 based diodes due to electrical stressing. We monitor progressive luminance degradation and recovery by introducing well defined relaxation time windows in the current stress cycles. The method helps to clearly distinguish between recoverable and permanent degradation systematically. The voltage shift due to degradation and recovery is also monitored as a function of time. Further, we introduce a method of reconstructing the transients of the recoverable part using progressive isolated current pulses as a probe. The recovery of degradation is related to the charging and discharging of the traps in the device and our method provides a technique of measuring significant parameters of trapping through luminance transients. The origin and distinguishing features of the two types of degradation are discussed.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Possible changes in the density of gap states due to the presence of crystallites is of central importance in understanding steady state and dynamic characteristics of devices using these materials. We have studied a-Si:H and pm-Si:H grown by PECVD at optimized conditions through the measurement of the steady state reverse current and their transients in PIN devices. The transients are analyzed using isothermal spectroscopic techniques such as Time Analyzed Transient Spectroscopy (TATS), and high resolution Laplace DLTS as a function of temperature. In case of a-Si:H, we obtain the expected signature of emission from a broad density of states in the form of stretched exponentials. In contrast the corresponding spectra for pm-Si:H are dominated by nearly exponential fast current decay processes with discrete energies between 0.20 and 0.26 eV.

Deposition parameters of pm-Si:H are such that small crystallites get embedded in a relaxed amorphous silicon matrix, thus improving the optical and electrical properties. We study the size of crystallites and degree of order in pm-Si:H using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pm-Si:H and a-Si:H. Raman Spectra of a variety of hydrogenated nanostructured silicon (pmSi:H) and amorphous Silicon (a-Si:H) samples grown at different pressures were analyzed. Deconvolution of observed multiple peaks in photoluminescence spectra and fitting to Gaussian size distribution also yields particle size to be in the range of 2.3 to 3.5nm in agreement with Transmission Electron Microscopy and Raman results.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Zinc benzathiozole, (Zn (BZT) _2) is a nearly white photoluminescent material and has promise for white LED applications. However, much of the charge process mechanisms for the material is not known. We study charge processes in such a hybrid structure by monitoring changes in space charge layer formed at junction of O/I hybrid structure. We study Al/ Zn (BZT)2 / n-Si hybrid device structure using a variety of techniques such as C-V characteristics, DLTS and Time analysed transient spectroscopy (TATS). Charge trapping centers ranging from 1.2eV to 0.25eV are observed alongwith unusual lineshape for some including processes faster than exponential. We demonstrate usefulness of these studies in distinguishing between origin of charge emission processes in such hybrid systems.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Four distinct emitting centers have been obtained using higher order TATS in the same silicon doped Al0.33As0.67As sample without use of hydrostatic pressure. Accurate identification of the multiple DX states has allowed a better understanding of the charge redistribution process during capture. Improved resolution due to increase in order of spectroscopy has enabled quantitative fitting of spectral lineshape and thus accounting for degree of nonexponentiality associated with each of the four discrete centers. The capture kinetics of these centers are studied over six orders in magnitude of filling time. The resulting quality of kinetic data makes possible detailed quantitative comparison with kinetics predicted by positive U and negative U models of DX centers.

The designed samples are in the form of homojunction and heterojunction device structures consisiting of p-doped and undoped layers which resembles the present day commercial organic light emitting diodes. The materials under consideration are m-MTDATA and Alq3. Distinct photocurrent transient signals were obtained under forward and reverse biased conditions corresponding to the mobility of the two different charge carriers. The mobility values obtained showed field and thickness dependence with an unusual negative field activation coefficient ‘β’.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",
                            " 'Correlation of I-V and C-V characteristics of single layer diodes for popular active organic materialsABSTRACT Even though display based products of organic semiconductors have started getting commer... more ABSTRACT Even though display based products of organic semiconductors have started getting commercialized, the charge processes and trap effects on the devices are not well understood. Though voltage (V) dependence of current (I) and capacitance (C) have been extensively studied in the literature, there are several features which are yet to be coherently explained. There have been several reports on the origin of C-V peaks attributing them to various mechanisms such as competition between diffusion and drift, traps, and carrier recombination etc. However, there is lack of knowledge on the origin of the nature of the C-V peak. In this paper we carry out a correlated study of I-V and C-V characteristics as a function of temperature for four different popular active materials to obtain a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. High quality diodes are fabricated with low leakage current so as to obtain large rectification. In the case of MEH-PPV and NPB, I-V characteristics show temperature independent hysteresis and signature of charge storage at interfaces. This is absent in P3HT:PCBM and pentacene:C60 based devices. In the case of MEH-PPV, pentacene:C60 and NPB, the shape of the C-V are similar (rises sharply but falls slowly) but the amplitude of the peaks varies with temperature. We correlate this to competition between drift diffusion giving rise to the peak. In the case of the P3HT:PCBM the shape is almost symmetrical on both sides of the peak, which seems to arise from the recombination losses. The peak positions are independent of temperature (in the range studied) in all these cases. In the case of pentacene:C60, as the temperature is increased, a second peak in C-V starts to appear. From the I-V, it is very clear that it is related to trapping phenomena. A thorough analysis of data is shown in Figure 1 and generalized view of correlation between I-V and C-V will be presented.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

In samples irradiated with doses below amorphization threshold, besides divacancy related trap, a new midgap acceptor trap level is isolated and shown to be responsible for carrier compensation. This defect level controls hysteresis in C-V characteristics and space charge limited current conduction in I-V characteristics. Possible origin of this defect have been discussed in the light of defect migration and cluster formation.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

A coherent understanding of degradation mechanisms is yet to emerge. We focus on intrinsic degradation of high quality Alq3 based diodes due to electrical stressing. We monitor progressive luminance degradation and recovery by introducing well defined relaxation time windows in the current stress cycles. The method helps to clearly distinguish between recoverable and permanent degradation systematically. The voltage shift due to degradation and recovery is also monitored as a function of time. Further, we introduce a method of reconstructing the transients of the recoverable part using progressive isolated current pulses as a probe. The recovery of degradation is related to the charging and discharging of the traps in the device and our method provides a technique of measuring significant parameters of trapping through luminance transients. The origin and distinguishing features of the two types of degradation are discussed.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Possible changes in the density of gap states due to the presence of crystallites is of central importance in understanding steady state and dynamic characteristics of devices using these materials. We have studied a-Si:H and pm-Si:H grown by PECVD at optimized conditions through the measurement of the steady state reverse current and their transients in PIN devices. The transients are analyzed using isothermal spectroscopic techniques such as Time Analyzed Transient Spectroscopy (TATS), and high resolution Laplace DLTS as a function of temperature. In case of a-Si:H, we obtain the expected signature of emission from a broad density of states in the form of stretched exponentials. In contrast the corresponding spectra for pm-Si:H are dominated by nearly exponential fast current decay processes with discrete energies between 0.20 and 0.26 eV.

Deposition parameters of pm-Si:H are such that small crystallites get embedded in a relaxed amorphous silicon matrix, thus improving the optical and electrical properties. We study the size of crystallites and degree of order in pm-Si:H using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pm-Si:H and a-Si:H. Raman Spectra of a variety of hydrogenated nanostructured silicon (pmSi:H) and amorphous Silicon (a-Si:H) samples grown at different pressures were analyzed. Deconvolution of observed multiple peaks in photoluminescence spectra and fitting to Gaussian size distribution also yields particle size to be in the range of 2.3 to 3.5nm in agreement with Transmission Electron Microscopy and Raman results.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Zinc benzathiozole, (Zn (BZT) _2) is a nearly white photoluminescent material and has promise for white LED applications. However, much of the charge process mechanisms for the material is not known. We study charge processes in such a hybrid structure by monitoring changes in space charge layer formed at junction of O/I hybrid structure. We study Al/ Zn (BZT)2 / n-Si hybrid device structure using a variety of techniques such as C-V characteristics, DLTS and Time analysed transient spectroscopy (TATS). Charge trapping centers ranging from 1.2eV to 0.25eV are observed alongwith unusual lineshape for some including processes faster than exponential. We demonstrate usefulness of these studies in distinguishing between origin of charge emission processes in such hybrid systems.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

A coherent understanding of degradation mechanisms is yet to emerge. We focus on intrinsic degradation of high quality Alq3 based diodes due to electrical stressing. We monitor progressive luminance degradation and recovery by introducing well defined relaxation time windows in the current stress cycles. The method helps to clearly distinguish between recoverable and permanent degradation systematically. The voltage shift due to degradation and recovery is also monitored as a function of time. Further, we introduce a method of reconstructing the transients of the recoverable part using progressive isolated current pulses as a probe. The recovery of degradation is related to the charging and discharging of the traps in the device and our method provides a technique of measuring significant parameters of trapping through luminance transients. The origin and distinguishing features of the two types of degradation are discussed.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

Though voltage (V) dependence of current (I) and capacitance (C) have been extensively studied in the literature, there are several features which are yet to be coherently explained. There have been several reports on the origin of C-V peaks attributing them to various mechanisms such as competition between diffusion and drift, traps, and carrier recombination etc. However, there is lack of knowledge on the origin of the nature of the C-V peak. In this paper we carry out a correlated study of I-V and C-V characteristics as a function of temperature for four different popular active materials to obtain a better understanding of underlying mechanisms. High quality diodes are fabricated with low leakage current so as to obtain large rectification. In the case of MEH-PPV and NPB, I-V characteristics show temperature independent hysteresis and signature of charge storage at interfaces. This is absent in P3HT:PCBM and pentacene:C60 based devices. In the case of MEH-PPV, pentacene:C60 and NPB, the shape of the C-V are similar (rises sharply but falls slowly) but the amplitude of the peaks varies with temperature. We correlate this to competition between drift diffusion giving rise to the peak. In the case of the P3HT:PCBM the shape is almost symmetrical on both sides of the peak, which seems to arise from the recombination losses. The peak positions are independent of temperature (in the range studied) in all these cases. In the case of pentacene:C60, as the temperature is increased, a second peak in C-V starts to appear. From the I-V, it is very clear that it is related to trapping phenomena. A thorough analysis of data is shown in Figure 1 and generalized view of correlation between I-V and C-V will be presented.Save to libraryEditCompare citation rank Readers Related papers MentionsView impact',\n",

MoS2 shows various nontrivial departures in its electrical properties in comparison to isotropic crystalline materials, however the understanding of anisotropic properties, particularly of charge carrier mobility in MoS2 flakes, is meagre. We experimentally study inter-layer mobility in mechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes.

However, excessive reverse bias leakage current in mechanically exfoliated MoS2 devices remains a challenge in developing electronic devices. In this work, we studied the mechanism determining reverse bias leakage current behavior in MoS2|ZnO n-n+ isotype heterostructure diodes, fabricated using multilayer MoS2 flakes obtained from two different sources, namely natural and synthetic crystals. These devices are characterized by using temperature dependent J-V characteristics in the temperature range between 145 K to 300 K as shown in Figure 1(a) and (b) for devices made on natural crystals (I-a-N), and Figure 1(c) and (d) for synthetic crystals (I-b-S), respectively.

Possible changes in the density of gap states due to the presence of crystallites is of central importance in understanding steady state and dynamic characteristics of devices using these materials. We have studied a-Si:H and pm-Si:H grown by PECVD at optimized conditions through the measurement of the steady state reverse current and their transients in PIN devices. The transients are analyzed using isothermal spectroscopic techniques such as Time Analyzed Transient Spectroscopy (TATS), and high resolution Laplace DLTS as a function of temperature. In case of a-Si:H, we obtain the expected signature of emission from a broad density of states in the form of stretched exponentials.
